Jay Kalsi,Pattern name: Lenovo Tab P11 Plus Tablet,5.0,‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê,Reviewed in India üáÆüá≥ on 17 August 2022,A decent Tablet,"The Lenovo P11 plus tab is a decent device for daily reading, entertainment or even office work (in productive mode and with an external keyboard and mouse).The build quality although is not refined as the iPads (which I have been using since past 10 years) but then no one gets to lay their hands on a good tablet at this price point. I was somewhat circumspect about the buying choice given that I have never used an android device before. I just bought it off a whim and also the fact that it would give me an experience with an android device. So far I am happy with it.The battery life is decent and lasts almost the whole day of continuous use. Touch screen is responsive and the best part is that Lenovo P11 plus does not have any junk applications and bloat ware. The interface is intuitive and it took me just a couple of hours of playing with it to get familiar. The chipset is also decent although it‚Äôs not the best there could but so would be the associated price.It‚Äôs a tablet that is suitable for everyone and for everyday use - students, casual mobile  gamers, office goers.Surprisingly after connecting to my apple keyboard and mouse, I have not used my laptop since I bought this tablet.Primarily I bought it to allow me to read my vast collection of eBooks and as an aid for online study.I would even recommend the Lenovo precision 2 stylus pen for this tab although it‚Äôs currently out of stock at most retailers. (I bought it from an official Lenovo supplier separately and am so happy with it.)Overall a decent Tablet which i would recommend for anyone who needs an affordable device for their basic needs.",Not Available,34 people found this helpful

Robert,Pattern name: Lenovo Tab P11 Plus Tablet,5.0,‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê,Reviewed in India üáÆüá≥ on 10 August 2022,"Best tablet I had so far, full recommendation","With that tab everything fits to my purposes and use cases - it has a big screen, a fast processor, enough memory (even expandable), and is even capable of voice calling. After two weeks of using it I'm still loving it as in the beginning, didn't find anything to complain.So far I had some videos running (streaming youtube, jio disney/hotstar and amazon prime video as well as watching some good old mp4-files), did some little works on some excel sheets, used firefox and chrome for surfing, synchronized with google drive and google calender, watched some fotos on google photos and checked my mails on gmail, everything works absolutely smooth and fine. At home it runs on my 5ghz router and fibernet, on the road with jio lte, until now everything at its best.I'm using my good old bluetooth earphones with it and keep it sometimes on a tablet stand. Everything fits. For keeping it in a bag etc. one should pay attention to the fact that this is an 11"" tablet and NOT a standard 10"" sized, sometimes this little inch matters. Charging is no problem via charger or power bank, goes very fast.It is almost unbelievable how much positive difference it gives compared to my old 7"" and 8"" tablets in all topics like screen size, speed and memory. Could even use an exchange offer and got almost 2.500 Rs back for my old 8"" tablet (which was still like new since I didn't use it much, I guess I used the new one now in those 2 weeks more than the old one in one year or so).",Not Available,7 people found this helpful
Arun Kanna,Pattern name: Lenovo Tab P11 Plus Tablet,5.0,‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê,Reviewed in India üáÆüá≥ on 21 August 2022,Value for Money - Power Packed for Productivity & Daily Usage,"First of all I had three tabs in a list to purchase before ending up to Lenovo P11 plus. Apple, MI Pad, Realme PadX. Looking for LTE SIM calling version is my priority so MI, Apple, Samsung nothing comes in 25k budget.So Lenovo & Realme pad x in this processor beats Realme pad x and i choosen Lenovo P11 plus.Coming to Lenovo P11 Plus i am using it for daily productivity purpose and learning purposes. It works like a charm. Using along with Logitech K480 & Lenovo 600 Wireless mouse . It is performs like hell sensitivity to keyboard and multi window usage this is great like Android laptop using Excel, Ppt, browsers etc.,No lags either in performance. Coming to HD video's this plays without any lag as it is Netflix HD certified. Video Clarity is very good.Battery back up is good continues usage stays for 30 hrs for 6 hrs device usage.Sound is very good at 90% & 100% but lacks quality at low volume at 30% 40% volumes.Wifi & Bluetooth connectivity is good. No worries about headphones jack as now a days everyone owns Bluetooth headsets.Only concern is face recognition could be better to unlock device hope to see in upcoming updates get solved. Battery charging it takes 3 hrs to full charge. Could have given 33W fast charging.",Not Available,18 people found this helpful
Anurag Bhatnagar,Pattern name: Lenovo Tab P11 Plus Tablet,5.0,‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê,Reviewed in India üáÆüá≥ on 4 August 2022,Excellent mid range tablet,"Likes:1. Good size (11 inches is better than most 10 inch tablets and there is more viewing area)2. The screen resolution is 2k which is so much better than regular tablets.3. The bezels are small and makes the tablet look modern and smart.4. Processor is decent for everyday tasks and i have seen no laga or stuttering yet. If someone is looking for high performance gaming then don't look here, rather don't look at current tablets available in India.5. The sound is loud and good.Dislikes:1. Does not come with pen. Neither there is a bundle pack created for it. Nor the pen is specified in the description details. So one has to research everywhere to find that the pen which works with this tablet is Lenovo Precision Pen 2. The cost of this pen is Rs. 3999, so not a cheap option.2. Same problem is with back covers and keyboard. As the lenovo options were neither stated here unless one does a complete search, it's very difficult to find it. Also availability is a problem.",Not Available,24 people found this helpful
