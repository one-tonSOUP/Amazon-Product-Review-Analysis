¬†Jan 6th:-Yet to get any security patch after Sep 2022!.. It has been 4 months since now.. I'm disappointed frankly in terms of updates.. I understand that the phone is due & should be amongst 1st to get Android 13 based MiUI 14 to arrive anytime now.. But that is not an excuse to not provide this long!.. I expected a Dec 2022 update atleast by now..In terms of battery there has been a decline in backup esp when on mobile data.. Thanks to 5G network now.. For whatever reason the auto brightness of the phone is continuously very high than what is required (adding to average battery performance).. There has been a few stutters in the UI I'm noticing which could be again related to lack of updates!.. Also I notice very aggressive RAM management performance where certain apps get killed immediately as soon as I get out of it!.. Possibly it's got to do with MiUI's irritating battery saving attempt..Anyways hoping for some improvements in my next update.. Fingers crossed..Nov 27th:-Got my vodafone primary sim ported to Airtel & have Jio as my secondary sim.. Both are giving me 5g internet with Jio giving consistently more 5g connectivity than Airtel. The Phone is blazing fast now in terms of browsing & YouTube etc.. Attaching some screen for 5g performance of the phone!..Oct 19th:-Got an update to enable 5g services for the phone. Under settings though I don't see any changes.Had been to Kashmir vacation where the phone was used fully.. The battery loss was quiet significant outdoors on mobile data with 2 sim cards.. The main reason for it is it's display that's almost at full brightness in auto mode.. Also due to poor signals in Kashmir, the phone is continously working to look for a stable mobile network.. The photos came out fantastic for it's segment & I was comparing it against iPhone 13 Mini/ iPhone 12 Pro/ iPhone 12/ S20 FE 5G of my cousins.. A lot of times my cousins preferred me to take the main cam shots from Xiaomi 12 Pro over others!.. The selfie performance was average at best though.. The telephoto/ zoom performance was toe to toe with iPhone 12 Pro in both photos & videos!!.. Coming to the most controversial video shooting performance, most of the videos ranging from 30 secs to nearly 10 mins in the most unique HDR10+ quality came out fabulous!!.. The video quality was not comparable to iPhone 12 Pro/ 13 as soon as the natural lights came down though.. The iPhones showed their superiority clearly in low light/ sunset videos..Will keep updating my experience further as days go..Oct 9th:-Have got September security patch. The routine is one security patch every 2-3 months typical of Xiaomi.. The update had nothing else other than security patch in it..The phone is otherwise performing same n is top notch & Im extremely happy with the device..Sep 17th:-Performance of the phone has improved now!.. Xiaomi has done some magic.. Even the phones highest cpu temperature against any load is only 60 degrees as against 75 degrees before!Attaching new benchmark app results..Aug 29th:-Attaching some screenshots from my phone for all the battery life cribbers & potential customers & interested fellows..I got a Screen On Time (SOT) of over 7:30 hours today!!!.. See for yourself before judging the battery life of Xiaomi 12 Pro.. I have also attached a set of screenshots from my phone settings that affect battery life..Always give time to your phone & the advanced AI in it to start reading what kind of user it is working with!.. My phone is 20+ days old now & it has learnt how I use my phone & how to optimise it.. So dont jump to conclusions by looking at your phone in hours!!..My phone today was used indoors mainly with mostly on Wifi but has 2 SIMs in it.. Bluetooth on for occasional smartphone connectivity & other settings in the screenshot.. Also reiterating that the phone has very good standby battery time too even with Always On Display..Aug 25th:-Attaching 4K@60fps video of 2 mins length.. I tried attaching 5 mins video I shot but Amazon says the file is too big to be attached!.. So I can't upload the 5 mins video.. What I can confirm though is no camera fogging visible anymore in the rear sensor.. Nor is the video shootage (both videos) had any fogging visible at all!!.. Remember we are talking about a phone that had it originally..After 5+2 mins of 4K@60fps, the phone was warm.. The battery temperature showed 45 degrees max.. Just FYI..Aug 24th:-I see a lot of customers are unhappy with the phone after purchasing as there is fog in the rear camera. They rate the phone 1 star & want to return it.. It's their wish as it's their product/ money..But I had a suggestion to kind off resolve this issue as I have done for my phone.. I made 2 videos today to test the situation.. 5 mins 4K@60fps videos each from the main rear sensor.. I had no fogging issues to note!!.. Just to remind the readers, my phone also had camera fogging issue while shooting videos from the main cam in the past (have made a note of it in my review below for reference)..So what did I do to resolve the issue.. Just shoot 5 mins length 4K@60fps videos from the main camera.. Shoot 10 videos back to back of 5 mins length in the same resolution.. The phone will heat up badly.. Let it heat up.. Once done shooting 10 videos.. Come out of the camera app & leave the phone to cool down.. Don't bother shooting a video to test anymore.. Give it 1 days time & meanwhile use your phone normally for any other function.. Test the video the next day & check whether the issue persists.. If it still does, you can return the product.. Otherwise all well & good.. I lost both 5 mins videos I shot this evening.. I will update a 5 mins video in a day or 2 for you to see the video quality yourself n whether there's any foggy tone in the video..Aug 20th:-Bought Xiaomi 12 Pro for 50K on Aug 7th in sale after card & coupon discounts.. Below is my experience so far in these 12 days;-Like to start with the display which is the best part about the phone.. This is one of the best ever screens on any smartphone ever!!.. A curved display that is 6.73"" E5 Amoled that is 120hz, LTPO 2, 10 Bit, QHD+, Dolby Vision, with 1050 nits max brightness (gsmarena tested) screen.. That has wonderful viewing angles, absolutely stunning hardware with no screen leak or dirty screen effects like it's competitors' inconsistent/ poor QCd units!.. Absolute ‚ù§.. A few cons that I noticed though is the phone has more accidental touch issue due to curved screen than say my previous phones iQOO 9Pro & Samsung Note20Ultra.. Also the phone doesn't come with a pre applied screen protector.. Had to get a good quality screen protector for 1000 rupees..Nextly the speakers & audio quality.. It's got Harmon Kardon tuned quad speakers (2 woofers + 2 tweeters), with 2 dedicated outlets, that is excellent.. Yes, it's not the loudest esp when compared to iphones & Samsung flagships & Oneplus flagships.. But the quad speakers show their speciality with a full range of sound & with it's richness during any kind of audio output.. Compared the audio with my wife's iPhone 12 (as good as any iphone 13 series) & that's where I make these observations.. Also I've owned Samsung flagships in the past to add on to the experience..Design & Build wise.. the phone is of the highest order possible with excellent design & color options along with a solid/ very stylish metal frame that syncs with Gorilla Glass Victus display on the front & Gorilla Glass 5 glass on the hind.. The bezels in the top & bottom isn't the snallest of all though n the curve at the edges could be more boxy for my liking than the current design that's more roundish.. All in all the phone syncs overall with the Purple hue beautifully to make it a piece of art!.. The only sore miss is an IP68 rating sadly..MiUi 13 on the phone is running July 2022 security update & the UI is polished & has excellent animations n look n feel!.. I have used phones with One UI, Color OS, Realme UI, Funtouch OS, iOS, Stock Androids (never used Oxygen OS though).. My most favorite UI for style n look n animations & feel has to be MiUI amongst all!.. The sheer array of Wallpapers (incl free Live Wallpapers), Themes, Fonts that's available for free is unbelievably good n incomparable!!.. The way the haptics have been integrated into the UI is best of all to add on.. The haptic motor is amongst the best too!.. All is not roses for MiUI though with slightly lower stability in terms of smoothness & consistency when compared to Color OS & One UI which are butter smooth.. The battery & general optimization is very well done though.. There were about 5-6 unwanted apps out of the box but most were straight uninstall while a few others I could remove using the adb function.. Overall very happy with the software experience so far.. Also adding on is a promise of 3 Major Android  updates until Android 15 & security patches for 4 years!.. What is to be noted is Xiaomi doesn't provide prompt monthly updates.. It is only periodic like say once in 2 to 4 months which is not great..Call quality over ear piece & mic & speaker is excellent.. The signal reception for sim card of various vendors - Vodafone/ Airtel/ Jio is all fine with very rare issues (I blame it to poor service than phone).. Wifi performance is fabulous with the best mobile modem attached to Snapdragon 8Gen1.. Bluetooth connectivity, NFC n all other modes of connectivity are top notch.. So very happy with these most primary functions on any phone..Cameras wise the highlight is the primary rear custom made 50MP sensor Sony IMX707 which is fantastic in literally every condition for photography!.. It has 1 big issue that has to be addressed though.. The rear primary camera fogging while shooting video for anything more than 1.5 mins.. But this rear camera fogging isn't consistent & sometimes it doesnt do it n fine too inbetween!.. But it's inconsistent for it's unpredictable performance.. The Ultrawide & Telephoto/ Portrait cameras consist of 2 50MP Samsung JN1 sensors respectively.. This is an excellent setup & they work very well for most functions.. The Telephoto/ Portrait cam has only 2X Optical zoom but that's a good enough feature with sharp & pleasing zoom pics.. The Telephoto cam lacks OIS which is a miss according to me & wouldve helped in low light zoom.. Similarly the Ultrawide cam lacks Autofocus & that doesn't make it a Macro cam which is sad.. All 3 rear cams can shoot good quality 4K@60fps videos with excellent stability!.. The night time photo/ video shooting is also top notch thanks to excellent implementation of bright flash with good flash timing & length to assist.. Overall very capable rear cameras.. Selfie cam wise it's a 32MP Omnivision sensor which isn't great hardware wise.. I would've wished a top Sony sensor instead.. The dynamic range of the selfie is very limited.. The phone takes a full 32MP snap & isn't pixel binned yet the sharpness isn't great n the photos come out slightly soft.. Yet Xiaomi's excellent post processing capabilities make the selfie cam Above Average overall for stills.. Night mode in selfie helps brighten the screen for additional light while autofocus assistance by the AI system for selfie helps a great deal overall.. Selfie video shooting is capped at 1080p@60fps resolution at max but has very good stability due to EIS.. Overall a very good camera experience considering I'm not too much of a video shooter..Battery backup has been good.. Yes I'm saying good unlike many in this forum.. The users should understand that the phone has an SOC thats amongst the fastest & more powerful on the planet n a sportscar can never give you a commuter car's fuel efficiency!.. Well apart from this logic have attached a couple of screenshots where I have easily recorded over 6hrs of Screen On Time!.. This is with always only at 120hz + QHD+ + Other visual enhancement settings + Always on display all the time + Live Wallpaper + high haptics but with only dark mode & Auto brightness enabled (Auto brightness is generally on high brightness most of the times).. The phone has excellent idle time battery optimization thanks to MiUI.. The 120 watts charger tops up the phone in quick time but has a USB Type A to Type C connectors.. It isn't say as fast charging as iQOO 9 Pro's more mordern Type C to Type C port that charges more faster.. Finally the heating aspect of the phone.. Please note that amongst the Snapdragon 8Gen1 phones like - Samsung S22 series, OnePlus 10Pro, iQOO 9Pro, Realme GT2 etc.. Only Xiaomi 12 Pro has unrestricted 8Gen1 speed (ie not downclocking the chipset in the fear of overheating).. The phone consistently scores above 9 lacs in Antutu with CPU score of over 2 lacs no matter any condition unlike all of it's competitors!.. The others have downclocked their chipsets to control overheating.. What this means is Yes the chipset is notorious for overheating when stressed.. I have seen a max of 75 degrees celcius of CPU & 50 degrees of battery Temperature when pushed to it's extreme in Antutu test.. Also when I shot multiple 4K videos of 5 mins length for more than 30 mins at a stretch, got a message saying the phone has overheated & give it a break.. So yes the phone has overheating issue but again only when pushed to heavy duty.. Otherwise for regular operation it is fine.. Runs at a CPU temperature ranging from 40 to 50 degrees & battery from 32 to 42 degrees which is normal..The fingerprint sensor is a regular optical unit.. It is nowhere near as fascinating/ secure/ fast as iQOO 9 Pro's 3D Ultrasonic unit that's just the best ever!..On the whole at 50K there cannot be a better smartphone than this ever!.. Really happy with the phone also considering it's cons..I whole heartedly recommend this phone to all until you are a frequent video shooter & a gamer (overheating issue)..","https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/514Sx44FePL._SY88.jpg, https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/51dzFM4Ye0L._SY88.jpg, https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/613vl2VG-TL._SY88.jpg, https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/617fRaOEXSL._SY88.jpg, https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61Cr6k1ypzL._SY88.jpg, https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61F3T1-MEML._SY88.jpg, https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61IUpnAE-iL._SY88.jpg, https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61Pa-UJtgSL._SY88.jpg, https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61R8Mjo7NML._SY88.jpg, https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61RRlmoQLEL._SY88.jpg, https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61ad-JwBFZL._SY88.jpg, https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61dr--MloQL._SY88.jpg, https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/7133fbps9kL._SY88.jpg, https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/713GgFbkV-L._SY88.jpg, https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/7185JHa+i4L._SY88.jpg, https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71ZzFwOUedL._SY88.jpg, https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71c7R5VITPL._SY88.jpg, https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71qQNH7V3wL._SY88.jpg, https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71zEBG4JuCL._SY88.jpg",479 people found this helpful
Prime User,"Size: 8GB RAM, 256GB StorageColour: Noir Black",3.0,‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê,Reviewed in India üáÆüá≥ on 6 June 2022,"Almost a flagship, but with lot of sacrifices and issues","The ratings i gave are considering other flagship phones in nearby price range from competitorsj(OnePlus/Samsung/Oppo/Vivo/Realme/Motorola/Apple/Pixel/Asus)!Battery drain is very significant even when idle, didn't expect it in a flagship. (Looses 8-15% at night, when always on display is off, vibration is off, mobile data/WiFi is off)[Update September 2022: With latest software updates, battery drain when idle seems to have resolved to some extent. Also, there is no performance sacrifices for this. So, now I wouldn't consider battery drain a huge negative point, as the charging is really fast]Also, even for for just casual usages there is slight heating issue, when outside temperature is 30-33¬∞C (an average temperature in India; For those in cold places, there are issues too... keep reading!)On gaming, it throttles a lot along with overheating at times, maybe given performance equivalent to Snapdragon 855 or 845, when heated up! Maybe going with Mi 11 Ultra would be a better choice, or go for 8Gen1 devices from other companies or wait for 8Gen1+! I really regret the decision to buy this phone, been using it for 1 week now!!!I have been using Xiaomi products for many years, and decided to believe and buy a flagship from this company. But so far the experience is disappointing, and gives a midrange feel in many areas... Over heating when used outside, for just regular usages, like Gmail, browsing the internet, Amazon etc... Also, though the charging is fast, the battery drain is fast too...And the camera needs a lot of optimization. Daylight photos, many times it's over exposed and over saturated and cases can be reddish. And HDR doesn't always work well. Its sometimes a disappointing performance, considering its supposed to be a flagship camera! Even that can be fixed by a software update...And maybe a good Gcam port is all I can hope for, if someone makes it, as i don't have much hope from Xiaomi... But surely there are hardware issues too...Overheating is surely somewhat an hardware issue, given the negative feedback of 8Gen1...But the implementation in Mi 12 pro, seems so poor, and it makes things worse. It's advertising industry leading cooling systems, but performance isn't reflecting it!Also, i recently went to a hill station(temperature was 13-20¬∞C) and on trying the camera there, the phone heats up even there on using camera for few minutes, and fog got formed in the internal camera lens of the main camera unit, which is quite disappointing!  (Note: it's not outside the camera, that it can be wiped, but inside the camera.And saw in online forums and YouTube that it's a general issue with this model, especially the Chinese and Indian ones! Search and you can find the issue)Hope the device doesn't get under-clocked, because I and most people who opt for a flagship care about high end performance.So Xiaomi, if you are reading this, we all hope, an alternative fix for overheating can be implemented with software that doesn't involve sacrificing the performance of 8Gen1! I will wait and see how Xiaomi takes feedback and fixes these issues(I have filled feedback using the feature provided within the phone)...I am not even sure if customer feedback is even considered and I am doubting the trust and decision of buying a premium phone from Xiaomi...On a positive note, the screen is excellent, main camera module is great in low light (though there are hiccups at times), also zoom camera isn't great, given its a 2x telephoto!The IR blaster, is a nice to have. Also it checks most of the features that is expected in a flagship. But it doesn't have an official IP rating, though they say its built to be IP 53 compliant. But flagships should be having IP 68.Performance is smooth, which is expected, but there are software glitches at times, and the issue of overheating and battery drain! As the battery keeps draining fast, and if we keep charging with 120W, battery life is a question... Don't think it will last much long!The charger is insane, but heavy and not very travel friendly....  And claimed charging speed of 18 mins isn't achievable unless phone doesn't heat up, which isn't possible unless you give it active cooling while charging!Realistically you get from 0-100% in 25-30 mins!",Not Available,304 people found this helpful
