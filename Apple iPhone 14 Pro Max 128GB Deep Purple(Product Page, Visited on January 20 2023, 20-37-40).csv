Jyoti Jitendra Mali,Not mentioned,Not mentioned,Not mentioned,5.0,⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐,Reviewed in India 🇮🇳 on 3 January 2023,Sound quality is very very good.  It's nearer to Dolby.,"I like the speaker very much, while listening songs I don't need any headfone to feel Dolby sound.Mainly everyone is aware about the camera quality of IPhone which is much better than any other brand.But only the issue I faced is of Whatsapp data transfer from Android to iPhone. Data we can't take backup from Android to iPhone.Overall excellent performance....",Not Available,15 people found this helpful
AVI deOry,Not mentioned,Not mentioned,Not mentioned,4.0,⭐⭐⭐⭐,Reviewed in India 🇮🇳 on 24 September 2022,Purchased this only for “Dynamic Island”,"The media could not be loaded.
                



 (Pre-ordered on 10th of September, package received today i.e 24th of September). I was already using iPhone 13 Pro Max from past 11 months and had say it is still the best value for money iPhone you can buy this time, at least in India considering huge price jump from previous models. I only purchased iPhone 14 Pro Max just because of “Dynamic Island” and tbh i literally got bored after few minutes of using and experimenting with it. Well definitely it’s a fresh design but is it really worth paying almost 40K extra for that new notch? I would say go with 13 pro/max and save your money. Also I am surprised that this iphone is so demanding this year, if you have already planned to buy 14 pro/max then you have to wait for a month or so…it is literally out of stock from everywhere. My scheduled delivery date was of 17th of september but due to limitation of stock i received this device so late.","https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/613DQP7csML._SY88.jpg, https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61Wjn6GxsgL._SY88.jpg, https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61jIIcX0bNL._SY88.jpg, https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71BTiDfC6mL._SY88.jpg, https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71I8z7SFucL._SY88.jpg, https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71NA24KMqmL._SY88.jpg, https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71NjpHNMu+L._SY88.jpg, https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71b9BZNO0OL._SY88.jpg, https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71ktu-rsDgL._SY88.jpg, https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71vxDfAFY1L._SY88.jpg",163 people found this helpful
Harsh Singh,Not mentioned,Not mentioned,Not mentioned,5.0,⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐,Reviewed in India 🇮🇳 on 25 November 2022,Best iPhone yet.,"Upgraded from my galaxy S8+ so I could feel a significant difference. The phone is off the charts, it’s that damn good. And the colour gold looks extremely gorgeous in person than in the videos. I carry my phone without a case and there is no doubt it looks like a piece of jewellery, gotten immense compliments for it. Won’t bore you all with the geeky details which can be easily found on the web. All I can say the interface is way too smooth and the dynamic island is a funky lil feature that I love the most about this phone. The always on display is creatively done, stands out in the crowd, ppl instantly know which phone you’re carrying. Plus when the album art of Apple Music that stays in the AOD is a lovely lil touch. All in all if you can afford it, go for it. Believe me you’ll not regret it, it is miles better than iPhone 12 and 13. The Pro models of iPhone 14 are definitely worth it. I got my money’s worth with this phone, it is absolutely gorgeous and pleasing to look at it.",Not Available,38 people found this helpful
